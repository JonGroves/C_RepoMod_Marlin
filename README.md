# CNC Milling Machine Firmware (Modified from Marlin 3D Printer Project)

This project modifies the open source Marlin 3D Printer firmware for use with CNC milling achines.  This firmware runs on an arduino mega, and receives gcode instructions to execute on a CNC machine.

Overview, Software and Hardware of my personal CNC machine can be found [here](https://github.com/JonGroves/Overview_CNCMachine).
